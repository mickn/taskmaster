# Taskmaster

Taskmaster is a completion guard for coding agents.

It addresses a common failure mode: the agent makes partial progress, writes a
summary, and stops before the user goal is actually finished.

## Philosophy

Taskmaster is built around one idea: progress is not completion.

- Evidence over narrative:
  The agent should not be allowed to stop based on a convincing summary alone.
  Completion must be explicit and machine-checkable.
- Same-session recovery:
  When a turn is incomplete, the right move is to continue in the same running
  session, not restart from scratch.
- Goal re-anchoring:
  Compliance prompts force the model back to the user’s actual request, not its
  own local notion of “good enough”.
- Low-noise enforcement:
  Native Codex hooks use a quiet semantic verifier instead of requiring
  marker-token boilerplate in every final answer.

## Core Contract

A run is complete when the assistant has satisfied the latest user goal and
the Stop hook's semantic verifier confirms that the goal is done.

Legacy `TASKMASTER_DONE::<session_id>` signals are still accepted only when
semantic completion verification is explicitly disabled.

### Codex Native Stop Contract

The native Codex stop hook uses Codex's `decision: "block"` continuation path.
On every stop attempt, it asks a quiet completion verifier to compare the
latest user message with the work already done. If anything is missing, Codex
is continued in the same turn with the verifier's reason and next action. Stop
is allowed only when the verifier returns `complete: true`.

## How It Works

- Codex path:
  - Installs native `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop` hooks in `~/.codex/hooks.json`.
  - Enables Codex hook support via `~/.codex/config.toml`.
  - `UserPromptSubmit` stores the exact user prompt that opened the turn.
  - The `Stop` hook prefers the current turn's stored prompt and falls back to the latest stored prompt or transcript reconstruction only when needed.
  - Every stop attempt runs a quiet semantic completion verifier.
  - If the verifier says the goal is incomplete, the hook blocks Stop and continues Codex with the reason and next action.
  - Stop is allowed only when semantic verification passes.
  - Optional repo verification can be enforced with a shell command.
- Claude path:
  - Registers a `Stop` command hook.
  - The hook runs `check-completion.sh`.
  - If the done token is missing, the stop is blocked with corrective feedback.

## Install

```bash
bash ~/.codex/skills/taskmaster/install.sh
```

Auto-detection behavior:
- Installs Codex integration when `codex` or `~/.codex` exists.
- Installs Claude integration when `claude` or `~/.claude` exists.
- If both are present, installs both.
- If neither is detected, defaults to both.

Optional target override:

```bash
TASKMASTER_INSTALL_TARGET=codex bash ~/.codex/skills/taskmaster/install.sh
TASKMASTER_INSTALL_TARGET=claude bash ~/.codex/skills/taskmaster/install.sh
TASKMASTER_INSTALL_TARGET=both bash ~/.codex/skills/taskmaster/install.sh
```

Installed artifacts:
- Codex:
  - `~/.codex/skills/taskmaster/`
  - `~/.codex/config.toml` updated with `codex_hooks = true`
  - `~/.codex/hooks.json` updated with Taskmaster `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop` hooks
- Claude:
  - `~/.claude/skills/taskmaster/`
  - `~/.claude/hooks/taskmaster-check-completion.sh`
  - Stop-hook entry added to `~/.claude/settings.json`

## Usage

### Codex

Run Codex normally:

```bash
codex [args]
```

The Taskmaster hooks activate automatically when a user prompt is submitted and
when a turn stops.

### Claude

Run Claude normally after install. Taskmaster hook enforcement is automatic.

## Configuration

- `TASKMASTER_VERIFY_COMMAND`:
  - Codex only.
  - Runs a native verifier before semantic completion is checked.
- `TASKMASTER_VERIFY_MAX_OUTPUT` (default `4000`):
  - Codex only.
  - Truncates verifier output echoed back into a block reason.
- `TASKMASTER_COMPLETION_MODEL`:
  - Codex only.
  - Overrides the OpenAI model used by the quiet semantic completion verifier.
  - Defaults to `gpt-5.4-mini`.
- `TASKMASTER_COMPLETION_VERIFY` (default `1`):
  - Codex only.
  - Set to `0`, `false`, `off`, or `no` to disable semantic verification and fall back to the one-pass self-check compatibility mode.
- `TASKMASTER_COMPLETION_VERIFIER_COMMAND`:
  - Codex only.
  - Replaces the built-in OpenAI verifier. The command receives verifier input JSON on stdin and must return JSON with `complete`, `reason`, and `next_action`.
- `TASKMASTER_COMPLETION_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` (default `20000`):
  - Codex only.
  - Limits transcript context sent to the semantic verifier.
- `TASKMASTER_MAX` (default `0`):
  - Claude only.
  - Limits stop-block warnings in hook checks.
  - `0` means unlimited warnings.

## Uninstall

```bash
bash ~/.codex/skills/taskmaster/uninstall.sh
```

Auto-detection behavior mirrors install and removes Taskmaster from detected
Codex/Claude environments.

Optional target override:

```bash
TASKMASTER_UNINSTALL_TARGET=codex bash ~/.codex/skills/taskmaster/uninstall.sh
TASKMASTER_UNINSTALL_TARGET=claude bash ~/.codex/skills/taskmaster/uninstall.sh
TASKMASTER_UNINSTALL_TARGET=both bash ~/.codex/skills/taskmaster/uninstall.sh
```

## Requirements

- `bash`
- `jq`
- `python3`
- Codex integration:
  - Codex CLI with native hooks support enabled
- Claude integration:
  - Claude Code with `Stop` hooks enabled
